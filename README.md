LetMeListen is an Android application that allows users to connect with each other via Bluetooth and listen, simultaneously, to the same song all together. It can also be used to turn multiple cheap speakers into a centralized Bluetooth based sound system.

The basic idea of the app is really simple: one device can either function as a station or as a listener. A station transmits selected musical files to its listeners using Bluetooth and can then control when to play, pause or switch track on all of the listeners. The listeners can only listen (and adjust their volume).

All musical files are stored as tmp files by the listeners and then removed when they disconnect from the station.
